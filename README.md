# pizza_sales
SQL data analysis project using real world sales data to derive  business insights on revenue trends ,top-performing products, and customer demand patterns.

# Project Overview
This project analyzes a pizza sales dataset using SQL to uncover key business insights such as total revenue, order trends, popular pizza types, and customer ordering behavior.
The goal of this project is to demonstrate SQL querying, joins, aggregations, and analytical thinking using a real-world dataset.

# Dataset Description
The analysis is performed using the following datasets:

->orders.csv – Order date and time information

->order_details.csv – Details of pizzas ordered and quantities

->pizzas.csv – Pizza size and price information

->pizza_types.csv – Pizza names and categories

All datasets are stored inside the dataset/ folder.

# Key Analysis & Insights
The project answers several important business questions, including:

->Total number of orders placed

->Total revenue generated from pizza sales
